### Research    
#### Managing Application Parallelism through Parallel Efficiency Regulation (2018-present)
- Poster: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3293883.3301497
- A daemon that optimizes system resource allocation by monitoring per-application performance metrics (using hardware counters).

#### Cache-Conscious Hash Array-Mapped Trie for Rust (2018)
- Source: https://github.com/chichunchen/concurrent-cache-conscious-hamt-in-rust
- Alternative to `std::collections::HashMap` that uses a lock-free trie with a contiguous allocator for elements, improving scalability with multiple threads.

#### Dynamic GPU Acceleration of Linear Algebra Computations (2017-present)
- Paper: http://prince781.net/unpublished/dyn_gpu_accel_lin_alg.pdf
- A drop-in replacement for BLAS and LAPACK that interops with cuBLAS or clBLAS to implement GPU acceleration in scientific applications.

### Work    
#### L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (2020)    
_Intern - Space and Airborne Systems, Clifton, NJ_  
- Implemented a test framework in Python for flight and mission control software

#### Cray Inc. (2019)    
_Compiler Software Intern, Bloomington, MN_  
- Improved OpenMP performance in Cray's clang+LLVM fork with optimizations for OpenMP fork/join  
- Improved debugging support with Cray's OpenMP runtime `libcraymp`

#### BrightLogic (2014-2015, 2017)    
_Software Engineer Intern, Midland Park, NJ_  
- Developed a GUI for monitoring hardware state of the ActiveFloor (a floor with interactive panels)  
- Created a ball tilt video game that ships with the ActiveFloor  
- Created a centralized configuration manager for various software components, using Angular and Câ™¯  
- Created libraries and tools for ActiveFloor software  
- Rapidly prototyped demo apps for the ActiveFloor to show to customers

### Teaching
#### Teacher's Assistant - Programming Language Design and Implementation (2018)
_University of Rochester_  
- Drafted and graded assignments, tests, and quizzes. Held office hours with students.

### Open Source
#### Vala programming language
- I'm the main developer of the Vala Language Server and work on tooling and support in the Vala compiler. I also contribute to the rest of the GNOME stack.
- Vala is a high-level programming language that compiles to C which then compiles to native code. It takes inspiration from C# and other languages. Vala has been used to write many high-quality applications for Linux and is used extensively by the [elementaryOS](https://elementary.io/) and [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) projects.
- [Over 170 stars on the language server](https://github.com/Prince781/vala-language-server/stargazers), and [over 5k installs of the VS Code plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=prince781.vala)
